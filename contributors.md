Significant effort has gone into the writing of these docs and the following individuals have contributed in various ways to their writing:

- greenfelt - he seems to be everywhere and had helped write huge chunks of the documentation about using Nova
- Emily - one of the community's star theme developers, she's helped write the book (literally) on themeing Nova for everyone from newbie's to seasoned veterans
- DeathKitten - she breaks things and hasn't been able to break the docs *too* bad
- Kate - one of the community's preeminent experts on the Nova wiki, she contributed in significant ways to documenting Nova's wiki
