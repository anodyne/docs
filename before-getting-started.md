# Before Getting Started

Here are a few things you should know before using Nova 2.

---

## Web host

Nova is web-based software which means that you'll need to have a web host to store your files so players can access your game's site.

### Prerequisites

Nova is built on two core technologies: PHP and MySQL. That means that when picking a web host it's critical that your web host have PHP and MySQL available as part of the hosting plan. Nova 2 has the following requirements:

- PHP 5.3 or higher (_5.6 recommended_)
- MySQL 5.0 or higher (_5.7 recommended_)

#### What about PHP 7?

While PHP 7 has been available for several years now, Nova 2 is built on a legacy framework that was created long before PHP 7. That means that while Nova 2 will work on PHP 7, there are potential errors that could pop up that you would have to work through. Depending on your level of comfort with these kinds of things, it may be better to select a web host that allows you to use PHP 5.6 for your game's site.

## Custom domain name

## Tools you might want

Throughout the documentation, you'll see references to uploading files and modifying files. While you can often do this work through cPanel or something similar that your web host offers, the easier option to have an FTP client and text editor available for modifying files and uploading them to the server.

### FTP client

For uploading files to your web host, you'll want to have an FTP client. Check with your web host to see if they have a list of recommended FTP clients based on your operating system. We've found the following FTP clients to work well:

- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
- [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) (Mac only)
- [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) (Windows only)

### Text editor
