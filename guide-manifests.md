# Using Manifests

Learn more about Nova's powerful manifest structure, including how its structured with departments and positions.

---

Young or old, every game will feature a wide variety of characters. Just as in table-top scenarios, each character brings a unique flavor and skill-set to that environment. Nova's manifest structure provides a way to list those characters in an easy-to-organize manner to allow for any player or user to freely locate and access information for any of the characters used in a Nova game.

The organizational structure is comprised of three elements:

- *Manifests*: the overarching container for a broad collection of characters of a certain type.
- *Departments*: a group of characters that are united for a similar purpose.
- *Positions:* the heart and soul of Nova's character system which immediately identifies the function of each character.

## Permissions

To edit any manifest, department, and position in Nova, you must have at least the *System Administration* access role, or your access role needs to have the appropriate setting management (such as *Site Manifests*, *Manage Departments*, *Manage Positions* etc.) feature(s) enabled. Typically, this feature is reserved for those who are managing the game.

## Manifests

Site manifests are an easy and the most basic way to organize characters within your game. Manifests can be created for just about anything, and can be as broad or as granular as you wish. Manifests are viewable by anyone on your site, from active players to prospective members. This is done by accessing the Personnel page from Nova's main menu, located on all pages of the site.

Nova ships with only the **Primary Manifest** created and enabled. Common customizations among many games include a manifest for *Guest Characters*, characters that may be used only during a particular story. In *Star Trek* games, for example, a sim based on a starbase may have manifests for attached starships, such as *Deep Space Nine* would have the *USS Defiant*.

When a manifest is viewed, the user will only see the characters that are attached to each manifest's associated departments and positions.

## Departments

Departments act as dividers within a manifest, organizing a particular group of characters. Typical departments within a *Star Trek* game would be Command, Security, or Science. A game set in the *Battlestar Galatica* universe would have departments for the Viper and Raptor Wings, as well as the Hangar Deck Staff.

:::Note
In order to display properly, each manifest must have at least one department enabled.

## Positions

Positions are the heart and soul of Nova's character system. Not only does a position define a character's primary function within the story, these positions are integral to how manifests themselves are presented to users. Positions are also required for any character to exist within Nova, and any character application must also be tied to an available position.

Many games can only support a certain amount of a character type. For example, a Dungeons and Dragons game works best when there is a variety of wizards, rogues, and warriors. Likewise, a *Star Trek* game typically has one Captain and one head per department, such as a Chief Medical Officer. If a game was based on Inferno Squadron from *Star Wars*, the positions could be based upon the soldier's specialty, such as munitions or sniper.
