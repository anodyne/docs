# Seamless Substitution

Learn about how you can tell Nova to use a different version of a file instead of what's in the Nova core.

---

The term "seamless substitution" sounds scarier than it actually is. In a nutshell, this is the way that Nova looks for files. Instead of just always pulling information from the Nova core, Nova will look in several locations *before* looking in the core. If it finds a file named the same as the one it's looking for somewhere other than the Nova core, it'll use that and stop looking anywhere else.

This system is integral to allowing games to modify Nova's behavior and presentation without the risk of editing a core file and having those changes wiped out when an update to Nova is applied. We've provided several different things you can use seamless substitution for, which are documented below.
