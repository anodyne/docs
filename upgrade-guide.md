# Upgrade Guide

Upgrading from Nova v2.x to v3.0.

---

Nova v3.0 is the first new major version of Nova since 2012, and as such it includes a wide array of breaking changes.

We don't take breaking changes lightly and have worked hard to make sure the upgrade path is as simple as possible. For most sites, upgrading should take less than 30 minutes.

## Themes

At a global level, we've renamed skins to be called __themes__ in v3. Realistically, this should only be a nomenclature change that will take some getting used to.

On top of just changing what we call them, we've completely overhauled how themes actually work. That means that any v2 skin will have to be completely re-written.

## Extensions

Likewise, at a global level, we've renamed MODs to be called __extensions__ in v3. Realistically, this should only be a nomenclature change that will take some getting used to.
