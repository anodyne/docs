## Badges

You can use badges to call out specific information in documentation pages. Badges should be on their own line and preferably come at the beginning of a section.

<x-docs.badge>Default badge</x-docs.badge>

- The default badge is purple and should be the one used most often
- Passing `red` in the `color` attribute signifies an error or destructive behavior
- Passing `amber` in the `color` attribute signifies a warning
