A skin is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript behind every Nova page. It provides the site with its basic structure and style. Skins can be found in the `application/views` directory.

## Where can I find skins?

The [Nova Add-ons Exchange](https://anodyne-productions.com/addons) features a wide variety of skins, both those created by the Anodyne team, as well as many created and shared by individuals from the larger simming community.

{% warning title="Use at your own risk" %}
Community contributed skins found on the Nova Add-ons Exchange are not officially supported by the Anodyne team and may not function optimally on your Nova site. Any questions or support for these skins should be directed to the creator(s) of the skin.

## The skinning guide

We've compiled a handful of pages that go into more depth about different aspects of Nova skins that should provide a good primer for someone getting into building / modifying Nova skins.

{% note title="Learning from others" %}
Another helpful asset when learning how to skin Nova is looking at how other skin authors have built their own skins. Feel free to use the `#addons` channel in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7WmKUks) to get help or find good examples to use for learning.
