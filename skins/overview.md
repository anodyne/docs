A skin is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript behind every Nova page. It provides the site with its basic structure and style. Skins can be found in the `application/views` directory.

## Where can I find skins?

The [AnodyneXtras](https://xtras.anodyne-productions.com/) site features a wide variety of skins, both those created by the Anodyne team, as well as many created and shared by individuals from the larger simming community.

{% callout title="Use at your own risk" type="warning" }
Community contributed skins found on AnodyneXtras are not officially supported by the Anodyne team and may not function optimally on your Nova site. Any questions or support for these skins should be directed to the creator(s) of the skin either through the *Comments* section of the AnodyneXtras site or in the `#xtras` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7WmKUks).

## The skinning guide

We've compiled a handful of pages that go into more depth about different aspects of Nova skins that should provide a good primer for someone getting into building / modifying Nova skins.

- [CSS Files](/docs/2.6/skinning-css)
- [Template Files](/docs/2.6/skinning-templates)
- [Uploading & Installing](/docs/2.6/skinning-install)

{% callout title="Learning from others" %}
Another helpful asset when learning how to skin Nova is looking at how other skin authors have built their own skins. Feel free to use the `#xtras` channel in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7WmKUks) to get help or find good examples to use for learning.
