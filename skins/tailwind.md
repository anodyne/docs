When we refreshed Pulsar and Titan for the Nova 2.7 release, we chose to lean on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for much of the underlying code. This provided a consistent design system to use that could be easily modified and extended to move quickly through significant changes to the skins.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started using Tailwind CSS for your own skins, there are a few things you'll want to make sure you have handy to expedite the installation process:

- [Install Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Have a [text editor](/docs/2.7/getting-started#text-editor) installed and ready to go
- Have a terminal installed and ready to go
