Learn how to skin Nova to match the style and spirit of your game.

## What is a skin?

A skin is the HTML, CSS, and Javascript behind every Nova page. It provides the site with a basic structure, style, and even a certain level of functionality. Skins can be found in the `application/views` directory.

## Where can I find skins?

The [AnodyneXtras](https://xtras.anodyne-productions.com/) site features a wide variety of skins, both those created by the Anodyne team, as well as many created and shared by the larger simming community.

:::Caution
All user-created skins found on the Xtras site are not supported by the Anodyne team and may not function optimally on your Nova site. Any questions or support for these skins needs to be directed toward the creator(s) of the skin either through the Comments section of the Xtras site, or in the #xtras channel on the [Anodyne Discord](https://discord.gg/7WmKUks).
