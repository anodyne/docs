A skin is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript behind every Nova page. It provides the site with its basic structure and style. Skins can be found in the `application/views` directory.

## Where can I find skins?

The [AnodyneXtras](https://xtras.anodyne-productions.com/) site features a wide variety of skins, both those created by the Anodyne team, as well as many created and shared by individuals from the larger simming community.

Community contributed skins found on AnodyneXtras are not officially supported by the Anodyne team and may not function optimally on your Nova site. Any questions or support for these skins should be directed to the creator(s) of the skin either through the *Comments* section of the AnodyneXtras site or in the `#xtras` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7WmKUks).
