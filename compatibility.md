## Browser

Since Nova is web-based software, you'll need a browser in order to use it. These days, there are a lot of browsers out there and most of them should work, but some of the older generation browsers aren't supported because of their lack of support for technologies and tools used in Nova. Make sure you have Javascript turned on as many of Nova's features require it. We recommend one of the following browsers for Nova 2:

- Firefox 4 or higher
- Google Chrome 10 or higher
- Safari 4 or higher
- Internet Explorer 11 or higher
- Microsoft Edge 12 or higher

## Server

- PHP 7.0 or higher (*7.4 recommended*)
- MySQL 5.0 or higher (*5.7 recommended*)
