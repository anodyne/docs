# Code Blocks

## Code Blocks

Blocks of code can be denoted by three backticks (\`).

    ```
    Your code here
    ```

For blocks of code, you can also denote the specific language to provide syntax highlighting.

    ```php
    $foo = 'bar';
    ```

## Inline Code

Inline code can be denoted by wrapping your content in backticks (\`).

```markdown
`class="foo"`
```
