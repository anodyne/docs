Significant effort has gone into the writing of these docs and the following individuals have contributed in various ways to their writing:

- **greenfelt** - he seems to be in about every Discord server you're in and has helped write huge chunks of the documentation about using Nova
- **Emily** - one of the community's star skin developers, she's helped write the book (literally) on skinning Nova for everyone from newbie's to seasoned veterans
- **DeathKitten** - she's brilliant at breaking things and hasn't been able to break the docs *too* bad, but she also has a keen eye for details and has helped smooth out the rough edges
- **Kate** - one of the community's preeminent experts on the Nova wiki, she contributed in significant ways to documenting Nova's wiki
