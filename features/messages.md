## Site messages and titles

Nova's basic installation provides each game with common and easily editable pages to help the management team convey to current and potential players important information about the game and story. These features are all contained within Nova's powerful *Messages and Titles* system.

To access your site's Messages and Titles, access Nova's control panel and locate *Messages & Titles* under the subheading *Site Management*.

The included policies are:
  - *Privacy Policy*
  - *Cookie Policy*
  - *Do Not Track Policy*
  - *California Privacy Rights Policy*

### Other messages

Under the **Other** tab, the following options are available:

- *Join Disclaimer*: this message defaults to a Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) notice, as well as basic warnings about the game. If you wish to add additional information, such as anything mandated by a fleet or organization that your game is a participant of, you will want to add that infomration here.
- *Join Sample Post*: if you are requiring a sample post from applicants, you can enter the prompt(s) for the sample post here.
- *User Acceptance Email*: create the basic template for emails that the system will send to each user upon **approval** of their character. You will be able to customize this message further when accepting a player's application.
- *User Rejection Email*: create the basic template for emails that the system will send to each user upon **rejection** of their character. You will be able to customize this message further when rejecting a player's application.
- *Docking Acceptance Email*: this feature has been depreciated in recent versions of Nova. The Docking feature is generally used by games under the *Base* gametype to show what other games may be currently "docked" at that base. If you are using the docking feature, you can define your default acceptance message here for any docking request that you may approve.
- *Docking Rejection Email*: this feature has been depreciated in recent versions of Nova. If you are using the docking feature, you can define your default rejection message here for any docking request that you may reject.

### Creating new messages

Nova gives administrators the ability to create their own messages to be used throughout the system, especially when creating their own pages and extensions. Once a message or title is created, it can be edited through the selected tab on the Messages & Titles page.

To add a setting, click first on *Add New Message* from the Site Settings page.

- *Message Key*: this is the function label that you will be using as you build your custom page or core extensions.
- *Type*: select *Page Titles*, *Messages*, or *Other*. This will determine what tab your newly created message will appear under.
- *Content*: enter any content that you feel is appropriate for the message or title you are creating.

When all edits are complete, select **Submit.**
