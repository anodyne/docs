Nova is a custom content management system that was designed from the ground up to help you manage and play online text-based role-playing games. It comes with all of the tools you need to manage your game and the flexibility to add to it as you need.

When it comes to building a website, there's no shortage of options.

- Write your own HTML and CSS
- Use a CMS or blogging platform like Wordpress or Drupal
- Reach for an online site builder like Wix or Squarespace

While these approaches are all valid and offer a lot of tools for building your game's website, we believe Nova is the best choice because it was designed from the ground up for the things you'll need to manage and play your game.
