## Why Nova?

There are a variety of options out there when building a website for your game. You can do it the old fashioned way and write all of the HTML and CSS yourself, you can reach for a full-fledged CMS or blogging platform like Wordpress or Drupal, or you can even reach from any of the various site builders. All of those offer a lot of tools for building your website. However, we believe Nova is the best choice for building and managing your online RPG.

### All the tools you need

Out of the box Nova comes with all of the tools you need to manage and play your game:

- stories and story posts
- helpful collaborative writing tools like post locking
- extensive character and user management
- valuable insights and statistics
- powerful developer tools
- ability for your players to manage their own accounts and characters
- highly dynamic forms that you can change however you'd like
- public-facing website about your game

Other options for creating your site will require either foregoing some of Nova's feature or building them yourself.

### Trusted for more than 15 years

Nova's roots begin with the Simm Management System (SMS) developed near the end of the GeoCities era and at the height of play-by-email systems. Email usergroups left much to be desired when it came to continuity and post management, whereas limited website offerings only allowed a game manager to update character bios, manifests, and other game information through a lengthy process. SMS was designed to simplify management, allow users to keep their characters updated, and establish a continuity among written posts. SMS was quickly adopted by the community, and a second major version was released based upon the community's ever changing needs. SMS soon evolved into Nova 1, and a few years later, into Nova 2.

Today, Nova software is respected and trusted by many across the simming community. Most importantly, its standardized and familiar system allows any player to quickly get involved in a game no matter the genre with no learning curve. Players can do exactly what any game manager wants, which is to be creative and write!

### Extensive community familiarity

Nova's codebase is open-source and built upon Code Igniter, a trusted platform for building dynamic websites. No matter what modifications are made on individual game sites, Nova's system is universal. A user can join multiple games using Nova and will be able to intuitively operate the software in order to participate in the game with little training or help.

Its open-source software has enabled many developers to create custom extensions, themes, and other features that many rely on just as much as the base system itself. Many of these customizations are available to download through the Xtras site, and are easy to install and configure.
