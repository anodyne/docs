## Why Nova?

There are a variety of options out there when building a website for your game. You can do it the old fashioned way and write all of the HTML and CSS yourself, you can reach for a full-fledged CMS or blogging platform like Wordpress or Drupal, or you can even reach from any of the various site builders. All of those offer a lot of tools for building your website. However, we believe Nova is the best choice for building and managing your online RPG.

### All the tools you need

Out of the box Nova comes with all of the tools you need to manage and play your game:

- stories and story posts
- helpful collaborative writing tools like post locking
- extensive character and user management
- valuable insights and statistics
- powerful developer tools
- ability for your players to manage their own accounts and characters
- highly dynamic forms that you can change however you'd like
- public-facing website about your game

Other options for creating your site will require either foregoing some of Nova's feature or building them yourself.
