## Browser

As of v3.0, Nova is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Nova 3 does not support any version of IE.

If you need to support IE 11 or older versions of Edge, we recommend using Nova 2.

{% note %}
Due to the use of the `:has` CSS selector, you will need to be using Firefox version 121 or higher.
