## Browser

As of v3.0, Nova is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Nova 3 does not support any version of IE, including IE 11.

If you need to support IE 11 or older versions of Edge, we recommend using Nova 2.

## Server

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
